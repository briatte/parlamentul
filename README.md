This repository contains code to build cosponsorship networks from bills passed in the [lower][ca] and [upper][se] chambers of the Romanian Parliament. 

- [interactive demo](http://briatte.org/parlamentul/)
- [static plots](http://briatte.org/parlamentul/plots.html)

# HOWTO

Replicate by running `make.r` in R.

The `build.r` script then assembles the edge lists and plots the networks, with the help of a few routines coded into `functions.r`. Adjust the `plot`, `gexf` and `mode` parameters to skip the plots or to change the node placement algorithm.
